# README




# OVERVIEW

We've looked at setting up the associations between a teacher and her students. The teacher has a class list of students and a reading and math proficiency score. For this lab, your models are already stubbed out, but you may need to update them to make your forms work properly.


Your README should include at least the following deliverables:
Models with appropriate associations and at least two validations

* The teacher model has a name and unique email address.
* The student model has a name and a  reading and math proficiency level from 1 to 4. 1 is the minimum and 4 is the maximum.



# PAGES
 An #INDEX that shows all of the students.
 The TEACHER#SHOW page shows all of a teacher's students in a dropbox.
 A   STUDENT#SHOW page shows the student's name, reading and math proficiency level from 1 to 4.
 A teacher can create a STUDENT#NEW for incoming students. Must include name and reading and math proficiency level.
 STUDENT#EDIT can change a student or teacher name.
 A teacher can DELETE a student who is no longer on her/his roster.
